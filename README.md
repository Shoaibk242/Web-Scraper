# Web-Scraper
Sample python scripts that can be used for web scraping.
This Repository will contain web scraping scripts for different websites that can be referred for learning web scraping .
I in no way endorse or promote unethical use of these scripts. 
These scripts can be modified for different websites according to the structure of the website. 
Dr_Duke_scraper is a example script created by me just to understand how web scraping works. 

Any suggestion or optimisation is welcome.
